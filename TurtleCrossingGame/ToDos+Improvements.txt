TODOS:
1. Create screen (600 * 600)
2. Make turtle. Should start at bottom facing north.
3. The turtle should move when the Up key is pressed.
4. Cars of random color should randomly go from left to right.
5. Detect collision between the car and the turtle.
6. Display level at the top left side of the screen.
7. If the turtle collides with the car. Display game over at the bottom.
8. On collision, all cars should stop.
9. Detect if turtle has reached the other end. If reached, reset and increase car speed now.

PROBLEMS:
1. Detecting collision with car. Unable to find the right condition. Current condition has anomalies.
   Anomalies mostly due to the unsymmeteric shape of turtle.
